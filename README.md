After replace the reading and math scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School with NaN, and comparing the school disctict summaries, we can see there is a slight change in overall passing math's and reading scores. The change is not very large (by 1 point), so we can probably safely colclude that it is not of a statistical significance.
