# School District Analysis Challenge
---
After we replace the reading and math scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School with **NaN**, and comparing the school disctict summaries, we can see there is a slight change in overall passing math and reading scores. The change is not very large (by 1 point) at the district level, so we can probably safely colclude that it is not of a statistical significance as per below.

However, the change is very different when we review the data at the school level. For example, the overall score for the Thomas High School drops from 90 to 65, which is a very significant change, and therefore can distort the results for that particular school.

We can also observe a significant trend reversal when it comes to school ratings. Thomas High School was rated as number two, but as we replaced the data with **NaN**, it has moved down towards low performing schools.
